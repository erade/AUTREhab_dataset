Title: AUTREhab Dataset - Wrist Rehabilitation Dataset

Description: The AUTREhab dataset is a comprehensive collection of data focused on wrist rehabilitation tasks using a Microsoft joystick. It includes two main tasks: "Circle drawing" and "CO-PTP (Center Out Point To Point)." The dataset consists of recordings from twelve subjects (indexed as "B" to "M"), with each subject performing five trials for each task, resulting in a total of 120 data files.

The "Circle drawing" task involves patients drawing circles of specified radius, with parameters such as shape radius, area, smoothness, movement time, and shape completeness being important factors.

In the "CO-PTP" task, patients are required to reach four target points positioned at the North, West, South, and East directions from the starting position of their hand. The dataset includes data for different movement orders, focusing on aspects such as smoothness, velocity, and completeness.

The dataset captures 9-dimensional kinematic data at a frequency of 50Hz, including Position (XY), Velocity (Vx, Vy), Acceleration (Ax, Ay), Jerk (Jx, Jy), and Rotation. These data dimensions provide valuable insights into the wrist movements during rehabilitation tasks.

This dataset is intended to facilitate research and analysis in the field of wrist rehabilitation, providing an opportunity to explore various aspects of performance and movement patterns. Researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts can utilize this dataset to develop and evaluate novel rehabilitation strategies, algorithms, and models.
